# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 1. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

label = input("Enter hostname: ")      # replace with an input() call
value = float(input("Enter GB used: "))     # replace with an input() call, converted with float()
limit = float(input("Enter GB total: "))    # replace with an input() call, converted with float()


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 2. Work out the difference and the percentage.       [Typical and above]

difference = limit - value   # replace with your calculation
percent = (value / limit) * 100       # replace with your calculation
# 3. Decide a status and store it in a variable called status.
#
#    Threshold : if / else        -> "OVER LIMIT" or "OK"
#    Typical   : if / elif / else -> "OVER LIMIT" (100% or more),
#                                     "WARNING" (90% or more), otherwise "OK"

if value > limit:
    status = "OVER LIMIT"
else:
    status = "OK"  # replace with your if / else (or if / elif / else)


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : wrap sections 1-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.

print()
print("=" * 34)
print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
print("=" * 34)

# your report lines go here
print("  Used        : " + format(value, ".2f"))
print("  Total       : " + format(limit, ".2f"))
print("  Free        : " + format(difference, ".2f"))
print("  Percent     : " + format(percent, ".2f") + " %")
print("  Status      : " + status)

print("=" * 34)


# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
